/** An Ataxx board.   The squares are labeled by column (a char value between
 *  'a' - 2 and 'g' + 2) and row (a char value between '1' - 2 and '7'
 *  + 2) or by linearized index, an integer described below.  Values of
 *  the column outside 'a' and 'g' and of the row outside '1' to '7' denote
 *  two layers of border squares, which are always blocked.
 *  This artificial border (which is never actually printed) is a common
 *  trick that allows one to avoid testing for edge conditions.
 *  For example, to look at all the possible moves from a square, sq,
 *  on the normal board (i.e., not in the border region), one can simply
 *  look at all squares within two rows and columns of sq without worrying
 *  about going off the board. Since squares in the border region are
 *  blocked, the normal logic that prevents moving to a blocked square
 *  will apply.
 *
 *  For some purposes, it is useful to refer to squares using a single
 *  integer, which we call its "linearized index".  This is simply the
 *  number of the square in row-major order (counting from 0).
 *
 *  Moves on this board are denoted by Moves.
